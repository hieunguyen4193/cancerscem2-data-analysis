We transcriptionally profiled 41,384 single cells obtained from fresh surgical human samples taken from non-tumour-involved lung (n = 4), primary lung adenocarcinomas (n = 8; 7 untreated and 1 post neo-adjuvant chemotherapy), as well as brain (n = 3), bone (n = 1), and adrenal (n = 1) lung adenocarcinoma metastases. These samples were derived from patients spanning various stages of tumour progression without enrichment for a specific cell type, such that the entire tumour and its microenvironment were sampled in an unbiased manner. Data from all patients were merged to create a global cell atlas of the normal lung, primary tumours, and metastases. Overall design: Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on 17 donors using the 10X Genomics protocol. For each donor, all viable cells (identified by forward and side scatter and DAPI exclusion) were assayed for trancriptome-wide RNA-sequence.","Non-involved lung, tumour tissues, and metastatic lesions were obtained from patients with lung adenocarcinoma undergoing resection surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC, New York, NY) after obtaining informed consent. Tissue samples were immediately placed in RPMI media (Corning) or Hypothermosol on ice and dissociated using both mechanical and enzymatic digestion (Human Tumour Dissociation Kit #130-095-929, Miltenyi Biotec), generally within 1 h of surgical resection. Tissues were minced with a razor blade in the Miltenyi enzyme mix according to the manufacturer's specifications and transferred to a Gentle MACS Octo Dissociator with heaters (# 30-096-427, 37°C) for further mechanical dissociation. Upon completion, cell suspensions were passed through a 70 µm filter and washed twice with FACS buffer (2% heat-inactivated FBS, 1 mM EDTA and Pen/Strep in PBS without Ca or Mg). Red blood cells were lysed in Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution (ACK lysis buffer) once or twice depending on red blood cell content, and final single-cell suspensions were made in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). For scRNA-seq, the remaining cell suspensions were subsequently flow sorted with a BD FACSAria II cell sorter fitted with a 100 µM nozzle to enrich for viable, single cells according to forward and side scattering, and DAPI exclusion. Cells were sorted directly into RPMI media with 10% FBS, washed thrice and re-suspend in PBS with 0.04% BSA for single cell encapsulation. The 10X Genomics Chromium Platform was used to generate a targeted 5000 single cell Gel Bead-In-Emulsions (GEMs) per sample, loaded with an initial cell viability of ~90%. scRNA-seq libraries were prepared following the 10X Genomics user guide (Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits User Guide PN-120233, 10X Genomics).

In this study, we performed a scRNA-seq survey of 56,440 cells from thirteen gastric antral mucosa biopsies from nine patients with Non-atrophic gastritis (NAG), CAG, IM or early gastric cancer (EGC), and constructed a single-cell transcriptome atlas for gastric premalignant and early-malignant lesions. The thirteen biopsies, including three wild superficial gastritis (NAG) ones, three CAG ones, six IM ones and one EGC , spanned the cascade from gastritis to early gastric cancer.For each biopsy, we isolated single cells without prior selection for cell types and utilized the 10x Chromium platform to generate RNA-seq data. After removing low-quality cells (Methods), a total of 32, 332 cells that passed the quality control were retained for subsequent analysis, which yielded a median of 1941 detected genes per cell.

Samples were incubated for 15 minutes at 37°C, with manual shaking every 5 minutes. Samples were then vortexed for 10 seconds, and pipetted up and down for 1 minute using pipettes of descending sizes (25 mL, 10 mL and 5 mL). Next, 30 mL ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS [ThermoFisher Scientific]) was added, samples were filtered using a 40µm nylon mesh (ThermoFisher Scientific). Following centrifugation at 300 G at 4°C for 5 minutes, the supernatant was decanted and discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL red blood cell lysis buffer (Sigma) and transferred to a 2 mL DNA low bind tube.

Single cell RNA-seq was performed on tumour and stromal cells from 4 patients with ovarian cancer to establish gene expression profile differences between the two cell types and also heterogeneity within the tumour population. The samples used were AS38b, AS59, AS74-1, AS79, they are grown in OCMI media supplemented with 5% hyclone serum (AS38, AS59) or 5% FBS (AS74, AS79) in 5% CO2 and 5% O2. At 37C","The acsitic fluid was centrifuged at 500xg for 10mins at 4°C and cell pellets pooled in HBSS. Red blood cells were removed using a red blood cell lysis buffer (Miltenyi Biotec) as per the manufacture’s instructions. Tumour cells were counted and plated at 1 million cells in two 75cm2 Primaria flasks, one containing OCMI media and the second containing a 50:50 OCMI media: ascitic fluid mix. Chemo naïve samples were plated onto collagen-coated 75cm2 flasks and cultured in OCMI media containing 5% Hyclone FBS. Cultures were incubated for 2-4 days at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 and 5% O2 atmosphere. Media was replaced every 3-4 days. Upon cell attachment, stromal cells were separated from the mixed sample using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA, and plated in gelatin-coated flasks in OCMI media containing 5% FBS. Once tumour cells reach 95% confluency, cells were passaged using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA, centrifuged in DMEM containing 20% FBS and replated at a 1:2 ratio.

The PDX samples were mapped to the human and mouse genome, respectively. To remove the cells with low sequencing quality, we applied filtering criteria using nUMI, nGene, proportion of mitochondiral genes, and averaged expression of housekeeping genes. Additional filtering criteria was applied to the PDX samples to eliminate human-mouse mixed cells. Total 3,934 cells met the criteria. After identification of cell type, the strict criteria were applied to tumor cells using nGene and inferred copy number variations.

However it remains challenging to distinguish normal cell types in the tumor microenvironment from malignant cells and to resolve clonal substructure within the tumor. To address these challenges, we developed an integrative Bayesian segmentation approach called CopyKAT (Copynumber Karyotyping of Aneuploid Tumors) to estimate genomic copy number profiles at an average genomic resolution of 5Mb from read depth in high-throughput scRNA-seq data. We applied CopyKAT to analyze 46,501 single cells from 21 tumors, including triple-negative breast cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, anaplastic thyroid cancer, invasive ductal carcinoma and glioblastoma to accurately (98%) distinguish cancer cells from normal cell types. In three breast tumors, CopyKAT resolved clonal subpopulations that differed in the expression of cancer genes such as KRAS and signatures including EMT, DNA repair, apoptosis and hypoxia. These data show that CopyKAT can aid the analysis of scRNA-seq data in a variety of solid human tumors. Overall design: We calculated single cell copy number profiles and inferred clonal structures of tumor cells from scRNAseq data using COPYKAT.","RNAs afe extracted from single cell suspensions Single cell capture, barcoding and library preparation was performed by following the 10X Genomics Single Cell Chromium 3' protocol (PN-1000075) single cell 3' RNAseq.",10X Genomics,Illumina NovaSeq 6000,RNA-Seq,PAIRED,1114,"R.

Although these cancers all derive from the outer skin layer (epidermis), variability in cell type composition and interactions causes substantial cross-cancer differences in disease initiation and invasive and metastatic potential. A knowledgebase of cell type composition and cell-to-cell interactions within the three skin cancers is needed to aid the assessment of risks and prognosis upon patient presentation. Here we integrated six distinct yet complementary spatial single-cell technologies to build the largest cell atlas and interactome of SCC, BCC, and melanoma to date. First, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on >50,000 cells from 11 paired healthy and SCC patient biopsies. GeoMx spatial proteomics data independently validated the presence of rare immune cell types defined by scRNAseq. Visium and CosMx transcriptomic analyses were performed for all three skin cancer types to map spatial neighbourhoods and construct a cell-to-cell interaction atlas. We independently validated two key LR interactions, PD1_PDL1 and IL34_CSF1R, using Opal Multiplex Polaris and RNAscope data. Downstream analysis of IL34_CSF1R signalling zones suggested enrichment of IL34-related antigen presenting pathways in melanoma. Overall, we present a valuable database and analysis approaches to reveal potential biomarkers of initiation and progression of the most lethal type (melanoma) and the most common types (SCC and BCC) of skin cancer. Overall design: Overall, samples from 12 human skin cancer patients were profiled by spatial and single cell multi-omics. Adjacent tissue sections from the same tissue blocks (FFPE - Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded blocks, or OCT- Optimal Cutting Temperature blocks) were used.","All samples were approved for research use under ethics approval numbers 2018000165 and 2017000318 by the University of Queensland's Human Research Ethics Committees and 11QPAH477 by the Metro South Human Research Ethics Committee. All formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks were previously prepared following a standard fixation procedure in 10% formalin, processed in ethanol and xylene and embedded in paraffin wax. The four melanoma samples (patients 6747-085P, 21031-08TB, 48974-2B, 66487-1A) were collected during 2008-2018 and all blocks were stored at room temperature. Full patient IDs are abbreviated as 6747, 21031, 48974 and 66487 throughout this manuscript.For BCC and SCC samples from eight patients (B18, E15, F21, P30, P13, P04, R01, D12), all fresh-shaved biopsies were obtained in accordance with the approved ethics protocol (11QPAH477). The patients presented to the Princess Alexandra Hospital Dermatology Department between October 2018 and February 2020. Among these patients, three patients (B18, E15, F21) were diagnosed with both SCC and BCC and biopsies of both cancer types were collected. Five patients (B18, P30, P13, P04, R01) kindly consented to participate in the collection of 4 mm punch biopsy samples of non-sun exposed healthy skin for paired scRNA sequencing experiments. Lesion identity was confirmed by pathological inspection. Portions of each sample from these patients were also preserved with 10% formalin as described for FFPE samples above. To process fresh samples for scRNA sequencing, briefly, fresh-shaved biopsies were collected in DMEM for immediate tissue dissociation. Tissue was incubated in 10 mg/mL Dispase II (cat. No. 04942078001, Roche, Darmstadt, Germany) for 45 min at 37°C, snipped into small pieces with scissors, and incubated in 0.25% Trypsin for 2 min. The cells were disrupted gently with a pipette and filtered through 70 µm and 40 µm cell strainers, taken up in culture medium and spun down at 350 rcf. Resuspended cells were collected in PBS containing Foetal Calf Serum for single-cell sequencing. For single cell RNA sequencing, the RNA extraction followed the 10x Genomics Chromium single-cell library preparation and sequencing. For the spatial transcriptomics, with fresh frozen samples, the RNA was drawn from the tissue sections to the glass slide by permeabilization and gavity. The polyA-tail mRNA were captured by poly-T. For formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples, the probes hybridized to the targeted RNAs inside the tissue, and successfully ligated probes were extracted and captured on the glass slide. 10x Genomics Chromium single-cell library preparation and sequencing was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the Single Cell 3' Library, Gel Bead and Multiplex Kit (version 2, PN-120233; 10x Genomics). Cell numbers were optimised to capture approximately 3,000 cells per reaction.For spatial transcriptomics, for fresh-frozen samples, tissue optimisation was performed as per the Visium Spatial Tissue Optimization User Guide (CG000238 Rev A, 10x Genomics), and a tissue permeabilisation time of 18-25 min was selected. For data generation, tissue was cryosectioned at 10 µm thickness and transferred to chilled Visium Spatial Gene Expression Slides (2000233, 10x Genomics, USA), and allowed to adhere by warming the back of the slide. Tissue sections were dried for 1 min at 37°C, fixed in chilled 100% methanol for 30 min, and stained with hematoxylin for 5 min and then eosin for 2 minutes, as per the Visium Spatial Gene Expression User Guide (CG000239 Rev A, 10x Genomics). Brightfield histology images were captured using a 10x objective on an Axio Z1 slide scanner (Zeiss). Brightfield images were exported as high-resolution tiff files using Zen software. This H&E staining and imaging protocol was used to stain all skin sections for histopathological annotation in this study. Libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq500 (Illumina) machine using a High Output 150 cycle kit (Illumina) at the University of Queensland Sequencing Facility, with the read structure as: Read1 - 28bp, Index1 - 10bp, Index2 - 10bp, Read2 - 120bp. The sequencing data was converted to FASTQ format as described above for scRNASeq data and the data was processed as described below. For FFPE samples, the FFPE blocks were sectioned at 5μm by rotary microtome and the sections were processed for spatial sequencing library prepration following the Visium Spatial Gene Expression for FFPE User Guide (CG000407, CG000408, CG000409 - 10x Genomics). The imaging and sequencing were similar to the protocol for the fresh-frozen samples as described above. Single-cell transcriptome libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 machine, using a 150-cycle High Output reagent kit (NextSeq500/550 version 2, FC-404-2002; Illumina) with the following reads and indices: read 2 (98 bp), i7 index (8 bp), read 1 (cell barcodes and UMI; 26 bp).",10X Genomics,NextSeq 550,RNA-Seq,PAIRED,3197,,,,/Volumes/HNSD01/raw_data/cancerscem2/counts/SCC-041-01-1A.counts.matrix.tsv,,,not yet,SCC,not found

However, the unique role of the immune environment in tumor progression for relapsed chemo-resistant patients remains elusive. In single-cell resolution, we characterized a comprehensive multi-dimensional cellular and immunological atlas from tumor, ascites, and peripheral blood of a chemo-resistant patient at different stages of treatment. Our results highlight a role in recurrence and chemoresistance of the immunosuppressive microenvironment in ascites, including MDSC-like myeloid and hypo-metabolic ?dT cells, and of peripheral CD8+ effector T cells with chemotherapy-induced senescent/exhaustive. Importantly, paired TCR/BCR sequencing demonstrated relative conservation of TCR clonal expansion in hyper-expanded CD8+ T cells and extensive BCR clonal expansion without usage bias of V(D)J genes after chemotherapy. Thus, our study suggests strategies for ameliorating chemotherapy-induced immune impairment to improve the clinical outcome of HGSOC. Overall design: Tumor leison, ascites and peripheral blood of a HGSOC patient were isolated and analyzed using scRNA-seq and scTCR/BCR-seq.","Within 6 hours after isolation, solid specimens were enzymatically dissociated into single cells. Briefly, the tissue was minced with a scalpel and enzymatically digested using 2 mg/mL Collagenase I (Worthington Biochemical) and 2 mg/mL Collagenase IV (Worthington Biochemical) for 30 minutes in a shaker (250 rpm) at 37°C. The digestion was terminated with DMEM + 5% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cell suspensions were sequentially filtered through 100 μm and then 70 μm cell strainers. Red blood cells were lysed by incubating the cell suspensions in RBC Lysis Solution (Sigma- Aldrich) for 3–10 minutes at 4°C. After centrifugation and resuspension, the concentrations of the single-cell suspensions were adjusted to 7–12×105 cells/ml with 5% fetal bovine serum DMEM. Ascites was centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C, and the remaining pellet was resuspended in PBS, filtered, subjected to RBC lysis, and resuspended as described for the tumor samples. Peripheric blood was collected into heparin tubes (Becton, Dickinson and Co.) and processed within 2 hours of collection. PBMCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque Plus medium and washed with Ca/Mg-free PBS. The isolated cells derived from above samples were used for further single cell sequencing. The suspensions of live cells in sterile-filtered PBS (Corning) with 0.04% BSA (Sigma Aldrich) were used as input for the 10× Chromium controller system (10× Genomics Inc.). Using 10× GemCode Technology, the cells were barcoded to separately index each cell's transcriptome by partitioning oil and gel beads to generate the Gel Bead-in-EMulsions (GEMs).

The GEM RT reactions were activated in a thermocycler (53°C for 45 min, 85°C for 5 min, 4°C hold overnight). Post RT incubation, the GEMs were disrupted and the first-strand cDNA was recovered. cDNA amplification was performed by PCR to generate sufficient material.

We found that PD1+ cells were distributed in different T cell subpopulations, not enriched in a specific subpopulation. In addition, there were other conserved receptor-ligand pairs (CCL5-SDC1/4) besides PD1-PD-L1 interaction between PD1+ T cells and PD-L1+ tumor cells.

Overall design: All H&E stained slides from eighty patients were reviewed for confirming PDAC diagnosis by a pathologist. The corresponding tumor and adjacent noncancerous areas were carefully marked. Duplicated 1.5 mm diameter tissue cores were selectively punched and transferred to recipient tissue array blocks. The tissue microarray (TMA) was set up.

This study aimed to delineate the immune landscape of PDAC and determine the clinical value of immune features in TIME. There was a significant difference in immune profiles between PDAC and adjacent normal pancreatic tissues. Several novel immune features were captured by quantitative pathology analysis on mIHC, some of which were significantly correlated to the prognosis of PDAC patients.

This study aimed to delineate the immune landscape of PDAC and determine the clinical value of immune features in TIME. There was a significant difference in immune profiles between PDAC and adjacent normal pancreatic tissues. Several novel immune features were captured by quantitative pathology analysis on mIHC, some of which were significantly correlated to the prognosis of PDAC patients. A risk score-based prognostic model was developed according to these immune features. We also drew a user-friendly nomogram plot to predict the overall survival of patients by combining risk score and clinicopathologic features. Both mIHC and scRNA-seq analyses showed the expression of PD-L1 was scarce in PDAC. We found that PD1+ cells were distributed in different T cell subpopulations, not enriched in a specific subpopulation. In addition, there were other conserved receptor-ligand pairs (CCL5-SDC1/4) besides PD1-PD-L1 interaction between PD1+ T cells and PD-L1+ tumor cells. Our findings reveal the immune landscape of PDAC and highlight the significant value of combined application of mIHC and scRNA-seq in uncovering TIME, which might provide new clues for developing immunotherapy strategies. Overall design: All H&E stained slides from eighty patients were reviewed for confirming PDAC diagnosis by a pathologist. The corresponding tumor and adjacent noncancerous areas were carefully marked. Duplicated 1.5 mm diameter tissue cores were selectively punched and transferred to recipient tissue array blocks. The tissue microarray (TMA) was set up. For scRNA-seq analysis, a total of six PDAC and six adjacent noncancerous resection specimens were obtained from the Department of General Surgery at Peking University First Hospital. All patients with PDAC did not receive any treatments before collecting specimens.","All fresh resection specimens were preserved in the tissue storage solution (Miltenyi, Cat. no. 130-100-008) on ice and transported to the laboratory in CapitalBio Technology company within 1.5-2 hours. To ensure the success of tissue dissociation, multiple resection specimens from the same patients were digested. All specimens were cut into around 1 mm pieces and incubated in an optimal digestive solution, including enzyme cocktail, consisting of the Type VIII Collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. no. C2139), DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. no. D5025), trypsin inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. no. T6522), and Dispase II (neutral protease, grade II, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. no. 4942078001). The single cell suspension was filtered with a 40 μm cell strainer (BD, Cat. no. 352340), then incubated with red blood cell lysis buffer (Roche, Cat. no. 11814389001) at 4°C for 10 minutes. The concentration of single cell suspension was determined using the Count Star instrument and adjusted to 1000 cells/μl. The cell suspension was loaded onto the Chromium single cell controller (10x Genomics) to generate single-cell gel beads in the emulsion using single cell 3' Library and Gel Bead Kit v3.1 (10x Genomics, Cat. No. 1000121) and Chromium Next GEM Chip G Single Cell Kit (10x Genomics, Cat. No. 1000120) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were suspended in PBS containing 0.04% BSA. About 6,000 cells were loaded to each channel, and the target cell will be captured about 3000 cells per channel. Captured cells were lysed and the released RNA were barcoded by reverse transcription in each GEM. Reverse transcription was completed in 200 ul tubes (NEST Biotechnology, Cat. No. 401001) on a S1000TM Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio Rad) at 53°C for 45 minutes, then at 85°C for 5 min, and hold at 4°C. The cDNA libraries were generated, amplified, and quality assessed using the Agilent 4200.

Increased knowledge of the tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) landscape in PDAC could lead to more efficacious immunotherapy. To generate a reference of T-cell subpopulations, we profiled 39,694 T cells from 57 PDAC samples and 22 uninvolved/normal samples, as well as 40,605 T cells from cultured TIL, using single-cell transcriptomic and T-cell receptor analysis.

The CD8+ TIL contained a putative transitional GZMK+ population based on TCR clonotype sharing, and cell-state trajectory analysis showed a high similarity to a GZMB+PRF1+ cytotoxic population and a CXCL13+ dysfunctional population. Furthermore, statistical analysis suggested that different TIL milieu profiles, such as dysfunctional and inhibitory populations, often occurred together in PDAC.

Single-cell analysis of human tumor samples confirms the presence of mixed lineage cells with elevated JAK/STAT and FGFR signaling in a subset of patients with metastatic disease, with implications for stratifying patients for clinical trials. Overall design: Here, we model the origin and dynamics of lineage plasticity in prostate cancer and its relationship to antiandrogen-based therapeutic resistance. In time course experiments utilizing genetically engineered mouse models and murine organoid cultures of prostate cancer.","Fresh benign and malignant GEMM and human biopsy tissue was mechanically cut using a scalpel into small pieces (~1–5 mm3). The tissue was then processed and dissociated in 5–10 mg/ml collagenase type II (Gibco) solution in adDMEM/F12+/+/+ with 10 μM Y–27632 37 dihydrochloride for 30 minutes to 2 hours on a 37oC shaking platform. This was followed by a 1 minute 0.5 M EDTA wash at room temperature, and subsequent digestion with TrypLE (Life technologies) with 10 μM Y–27632 dihydrochloride for 5–10 minutes at 37oC on a shaking platform until a single cell suspension was obtained. For human samples, if more than 10% of doublets were present (visual inspection) or there was evidence for <80% viability (hemocytometer, using 0.2% Trypan Blue), then cells were FACS–sorted for singlets and viability using a DAPI. For GEMM tissue, all cells were subsequently FACS–sorted for singlets and viability using DAPI. Organoids were isolated from basement membrane extract digested to single-cell suspension by incubating with TrypLE (Life technologies) supplemented with Y-27632 (10 μM) for 10 min at 37 °C with shaking, followed by a 2-min incubation with EDTA (1 mM), Y-27632 (10 μM) in PBS0 and a second digestion with TrypLE (Life technologies) supplemented with Y-27632 for 5 min at 37 °C with shaking. Cells were filtered and resuspended in PBS0, Y-27632 (10 μM) and BSA (0.04%) before processing further for single-cell sequencing. Cells were checked for viability using 0.2% (w/v) Trypan Blue staining (Countess II) and all sequencing experiments were performed on samples with a minimum of 80% viable cells. Single-cell encapsulation and scRNA-seq library prep of FACS-sorted cell suspensions was performed on the Chromium instrument (10x Genomics) following the user manual (Reagent Kit 3' v2 for organoids and GEMM or v3 for HMP samples).

How this plasticity unfolds at a molecular level and whether it plays a causal role in drug resistance remains unclear. Here, we model the origin and dynamics of lineage plasticity in prostate cancer and its relationship to antiandrogen-based therapeutic resistance. In time course experiments utilizing genetically engineered mouse models and murine organoid cultures of prostate cancer, we find that plasticity initiates in an epithelial population defined by mixed luminal and basal lineage gene expression, and that it depends on elevated JAK and FGFR kinase activity. Organoid cultures from patients with late-stage castration-resistant disease harboring mixed-lineage cells reproduce the dependency we observe in mice, by upregulating luminal gene expression upon JAK and FGFR kinase inhibitor treatment. Single-cell analysis of human tumor samples confirms the presence of mixed lineage cells with elevated JAK/STAT and FGFR signaling in a subset of patients with metastatic disease, with implications for stratifying patients for clinical trials.

This shortage of treatments is due to limited knowledge about ependymoma tumorigenic mechanisms. By means of single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiling of posterior fossa primary tumors and distal metastases, we reveal key transcription factors and enhancers associated with the differentiation of ependymoma tumor cells into tumor-derived cell lineages and their transition into a mesenchymal-like state. We identify NFkB, AP-1, and MYC as mediators of this transition, and show that the gene expression profiles of tumor cells and infiltrating microglia are consistent with abundant pro-inflammatory signaling between these populations. In line with these results, both TGF-b1 and TNF-a induce the expression of mesenchymal genes on a patient-derived cell model, and TGF-b1 leads to an invasive phenotype. Altogether, these data suggest that tumor gliosis induced by inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress underlies the mesenchymal phenotype of posterior fossa ependymoma.

Despite a favorable response for a subset of patients, others experience primary progressive disease highlighting the need to precisely understand plasticity of cancer cells and their crosstalk with the microenvironment to better predict therapeutic response and personalize treatment. Single-cell RNA sequencing of ccRCC at different disease stages and normal adjacent tissue (NAT) from patients identified 46 cell populations, including 5 tumor subpopulations, characterized by distinct transcriptional signatures representing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition gradient and a novel inflamed state. Deconvolution of the tumor and microenvironment signatures in public datasets and in data from the BIONIKK clinical trial (NCT02960906) revealed a strong correlation between mesenchymal-like ccRCC cells and myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts (myCAFs), which are both enriched in metastases and correlate with poor patient survival. Spatial transcriptomics and multiplex immune staining uncovered spatial proximity of mesenchymal-like ccRCC cells and myCAFs at the tumor-NAT interface. Moreover, enrichment in myCAFs was associated with primary resistance to ICI therapy in the BIONIKK clinical trial. This data highlights the epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity of ccRCC cancer cells and their relationship with myCAFs, a critical component of the microenvironment associated with poor outcome and ICI resistance.

Molecular stratification in pancreatic cancer remains rudimentary and does not yet inform clinical management or therapeutic development. Here we construct a high-resolution molecular landscape of the multicellular subtypes and spatial communities that compose PAC using single-nucleus RNA-seq and whole-transcriptome digital spatial profiling (SP) of 43 primary PDAC tumor specimens that either received neoadjuvant therapy or were treatment-naïve. We uncovered expression programs across malignant cells and fibroblasts, including a newly-identified neural-like progenitor malignant cell program that was enriched after chemotherapy and radiotherapy and associated with poor prognosis in independent cohorts. Integrating spatial and cellular profiles revealed three multicellular communities: classical, squamoid-basaloid, and treatment-enriched. Our refined molecular and cellular taxonomy can advance precision oncology in PAC through stratification in clinical trials and as roadmap for therapeutic targeting of specific cellular phenotypes and multicellular interactions. Overall design: 18 specimens received no treatment prior to resection; 25 specimens received neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (e.g. CRT = FOLFIRINOX), losartan (L), and/or nivolumab (N) prior to resection; 2 specimens were non-malignant.","Resected primary tumor samples were snap frozen and stored at -80°C. Selected tissue was transferred into an NSTcPA buffer and manually minced. Nuclei from each sample were loaded into each channel of a Chromium single-cell 3' chip according to the manufacturer's instructions. Single nuclei were partitioned into droplets with gel beads in the Chromium Controller to form emulsions, after which nuclear lysis, barcoded reverse transcription of mRNA, cDNA amplification, enzymatic fragmentation, and 5' adaptor and sample index attachment were performed according to manufacturer's instructions.

Systematic interrogation of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is vital to the prediction of immunotherapy response and the development of innovative immunotherapeutics. To comprehensively characterize the immune microenvironment in advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC), we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing in unselected viable cells from 16 matched samples. We identified nineteen cell subsets from a total of 45,851 cells, in which exhausted CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) in BTC were shown to augment and communicate within the TME. Transcriptional profiles coupled with T cell receptor (TCR) sequences revealed that exhausted CD8+ T cells retained clonal expansion and high proliferation in the TME, and some of them highly expressed the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER) sensor XBP1, indicating its key role in remodeling TME. Functional assays demonstrated that XBP1 and common immune checkpoints (PD1, TIGIT) were significantly upregulated in CD8+ T cells cocultured within the TME of BTC cell lines (GBC-SD, HCCC-9810). When treating the coculture groups with the specific inhibitor of IRE1a-XBP1 (4µ8C), the downregulation of TIGIT was observed in the treatment group. Collectively, comprehensive transcriptome profiling provides deeper insights into the immune atlas in advanced BTC, which might be instrumental in exploring novel immunotherapy strategies. Overall design: Five patients diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma in the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital were incorporated into the current study, including two intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), two gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) and one dCCA patients. Of note, none of the patients have undergone any preoperative treatments (chemotherapy, radiation or anti-tumor medicines) prior to tumor resection. Tumor primary locus and metastasis as well as lymph node were consistently harvested for each participant, if available. Meanwhile, peripheral blood samples were collected prior to surgical procedures using anticoagulant tubes.","Fresh surgical resected samples were rinsed with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), which were subsequently minced and digested with digestive buffer, followed by incubation for 60 min at 37 °C with gentle shaking. The digestive buffer was conFigured by dissolving digestive enzyme into RPMI with 10% serum, including deoxyribonuclease type I, collagenase IV, and hyaluronidase type V.

Tissue derived leukocytes were obtained by collecting the middle layer of the mixture. CountessII Automated Cell Counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was applied to determine viability and density of mononuclear cells from tumor, lymph node and peripheral blood. Single cell suspensions were then processed for single-cell gene expression (scRNA-seq) as well as single cell T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes (scTCR-seq) using Chromium Controller. Single cells were adjusted to an ideal concentration of 5×10^5 to 1×10^6 cells/mL with a viability higher than 70%.

Systematic interrogation of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is vital to the prediction of immunotherapy response and the development of innovative immunotherapeutics. To comprehensively characterize the immune microenvironment in advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC), we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing in unselected viable cells from 16 matched samples. We identified nineteen cell subsets from a total of 45,851 cells, in which exhausted CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) in BTC were shown to augment and communicate within the TME. Transcriptional profiles coupled with T cell receptor (TCR) sequences revealed that exhausted CD8+ T cells retained clonal expansion and high proliferation in the TME, and some of them highly expressed the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER) sensor XBP1, indicating its key role in remodeling TME. Functional assays demonstrated that XBP1 and common immune checkpoints (PD1, TIGIT) were significantly upregulated in CD8+ T cells cocultured within the TME of BTC cell lines (GBC-SD, HCCC-9810). When treating the coculture groups with the specific inhibitor of IRE1a-XBP1 (4µ8C), the downregulation of TIGIT was observed in the treatment group.

Dissociation of nuclei was carried out entirely on wet ice. 40-60mg of flash-frozen tissue was placed into 2ml dounce tissue grinders containing 1ml HB (Lysis) Buffer (1.0341x HB Stable solution, 1M DTT, 500 mM Spermidine, 150mM Spermine, 10% NP40, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor, Ribolock), gently triturated, then allowed to thaw for 5 minutes in the solution. After 5 minutes, tissue was dounced 10 times with pestle A and 20 times with pestle B, or until there was no resistance from either pestle. Sample was filtered through a 40um cell strainer (Falcon; 352340) and resulting homogenate transferred to a pre-chilled 2ml LoBind tube. Samples were spun in a 4°C fixed angle centrifuge for 5 minutes at 350 RCF to pellet nuclei. After spinning, all but 50ul of supernatant was removed. 350ul HB was added to the nuclei pellet for a total volume of 400ul. Nuclei were gently resuspended with a wide bore pipet. One volume of 50% Iodixanol (60% OptiPrep [Sigma Aldrich; D1556], Diluent Buffer [2M KCl, 1M MgCl2, 0.75M Tricine-KOH pH 7.8], Water) was added and gently triturated. Next, 600ul of 30% Iodixanol was carefully layered under the 25% mixture. Finally, 600ul of 40% Iodixanol was layered under the 30% mixture. Sample was then spun in a 4°C swinging bucket centrifuge for 20 min at 3,000 RCF. Upon completion of the spin, a band of nuclei was visible. Supernatant was aspirated down to within 200-300ul of the nuclei band. The nuclei band was then collected at 200ul and transferred to a fresh 1.5ml tube. Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods. HB buffer was prepared following the OmniATAC protocol, with the addition of 15ul Ribolock per 1mL HB buffer to help maintain RNA integrity. Approximately 50-70mg tissue in small chunks were placed into the Nuclei Isolation Cartridge.

Dissociation of nuclei was carried out entirely on wet ice. 40-60mg of flash-frozen tissue was placed into 2ml dounce tissue grinders containing 1ml HB (Lysis) Buffer (1.0341x HB Stable solution, 1M DTT, 500 mM Spermidine, 150mM Spermine, 10% NP40, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor, Ribolock), gently triturated, then allowed to thaw for 5 minutes in the solution. After 5 minutes, tissue was dounced 10 times with pestle A and 20 times with pestle B, or until there was no resistance from either pestle. Sample was filtered through a 40um cell strainer (Falcon; 352340) and resulting homogenate transferred to a pre-chilled 2ml LoBind tube. Samples were spun in a 4°C fixed angle centrifuge for 5 minutes at 350 RCF to pellet nuclei. After spinning, all but 50ul of supernatant was removed. 350ul HB was added to the nuclei pellet for a total volume of 400ul. Nuclei were gently resuspended with a wide bore pipet. One volume of 50% Iodixanol (60% OptiPrep [Sigma Aldrich; D1556], Diluent Buffer [2M KCl, 1M MgCl2, 0.75M Tricine-KOH pH 7.8], Water) was added and gently triturated. Next, 600ul of 30% Iodixanol was carefully layered under the 25% mixture. Finally, 600ul of 40% Iodixanol was layered under the 30% mixture. Sample was then spun in a 4°C swinging bucket centrifuge for 20 min at 3,000 RCF. Upon completion of the spin, a band of nuclei was visible. Supernatant was aspirated down to within 200-300ul of the nuclei band. The nuclei band was then collected at 200ul and transferred to a fresh 1.5ml tube. Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods.

Supernatant was aspirated down to within 200-300ul of the nuclei band. The nuclei band was then collected at 200ul and transferred to a fresh 1.5ml tube. Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods. HB buffer was prepared following the OmniATAC protocol, with the addition of 15ul Ribolock per 1mL HB buffer to help maintain RNA integrity. Approximately 50-70mg tissue in small chunks were placed into the Nuclei Isolation Cartridge. We ran the Extended Nuclei Isolation Singulator program which includes disruption, 5 minute incubation, disruption, filtration (150um and 40um filters) and buffer rinse of the cartridge. Following dissociation, nuclei were spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in Resuspension Buffer (noted above). Nuclei were counted using the Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher). The total dissociation time for 4 samples was approximately 1 hour, as one sample can be run at a time on the S2 Singulator. snRNA-seq targeting 9,000 cells per sample was performed using Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits v3.1 (10x Genomics, 1000121) and Chromium Next GEM Chip G Single Cell Kit (10x Genomics, 1000120).",10X Genomics,Illumina NovaSeq 6000,RNA-Seq,PAIRED,9201,"W.R.

We find that a large fraction of polyp and CRC cells exhibit a stem-like phenotype, and we define a continuum of epigenetic and transcriptional changes occurring in these stem-like cells as they progress from homeostasis to CRC.  Overall design: Nuclei from unaffected colon, polyps, and CRC samples were isolated with douncing. Following nuclei isolation, 10x scRNAseq and scATAC-seq assays were performed.","The isolation of nuclei was accomplished using the OmniATAC protocol (Corces*, Granja* et al. Science 362, 2018). Dissociation of nuclei was carried out entirely on wet ice. 40-60mg of flash-frozen tissue was placed into 2ml dounce tissue grinders containing 1ml HB (Lysis) Buffer (1.0341x HB Stable solution, 1M DTT, 500 mM Spermidine, 150mM Spermine, 10% NP40, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor, Ribolock), gently triturated, then allowed to thaw for 5 minutes in the solution. After 5 minutes, tissue was dounced 10 times with pestle A and 20 times with pestle B, or until there was no resistance from either pestle. Sample was filtered through a 40um cell strainer (Falcon; 352340) and resulting homogenate transferred to a pre-chilled 2ml LoBind tube. Samples were spun in a 4°C fixed angle centrifuge for 5 minutes at 350 RCF to pellet nuclei. After spinning, all but 50ul of supernatant was removed. 350ul HB was added to the nuclei pellet for a total volume of 400ul. Nuclei were gently resuspended with a wide bore pipet. One volume of 50% Iodixanol (60% OptiPrep [Sigma Aldrich; D1556], Diluent Buffer [2M KCl, 1M MgCl2, 0.75M Tricine-KOH pH 7.8], Water) was added and gently triturated. Next, 600ul of 30% Iodixanol was carefully layered under the 25% mixture. Finally, 600ul of 40% Iodixanol was layered under the 30% mixture. Sample was then spun in a 4°C swinging bucket centrifuge for 20 min at 3,000 RCF. Upon completion of the spin, a band of nuclei was visible.

Overall design: To comprehensively elucidate the inter-tumor heterogeneity of bilateral PTC, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile 29,561 cells from 3 pairs of bilateral PTCs and 1 non-tumor thyroid sample. Our integrative analyses revealed great inter-tumor heterogeneity within tumor microenvironment in bilateral PTCs, which will offer assistance for precise diagnosis and treatment.","All freshly resected thyroid specimens were immediately washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and digested with digestive enzyme mixture containing 10 ml pre-warmed RPMI 1640 (ThermoFisher Scientific), 1 mg/ml type IV collagenase (Sigma), 2 mg/ml dispase (Roche), and 10 U/µl DNase (Roche) for an hour at 37°C. The reaction was deactivated by adding 10% FBS (ThermoFisher Scientific). Cell suspensions were filtered using a 70 μm filter and then centrifuged at 500 rpm for 6 min at 4°C to pellet dead cells and red blood cells. The cells were washed twice and suspended in PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma). Cell suspension (300-600 living cells per microliter determined by Count Star) was loaded onto the Chromium single cell controller (10x Genomics) to generate single-cell gel beads in the emulsion using single cell 3 'Library and Gel Bead Kit V3.1(10x Genomics, 1000121) and Chromium Single Cell G Chip Kit (10x Genomics, 1000120) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In short, single cells were suspended in PBS containing 0.04% BSA. About 6,000 cells were added to each channel, and the target cell that will be recovered was estimated to be about 3,000 cells. Captured cells were lysed and the released RNA were barcoded through reverse transcription in individual GEMs. Reverse transcription was performed on a S1000TM Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio Rad) at 53°C for 45 min, followed by 85°C for 5 min, and hold at 4°C. The cDNA was generated and then amplified, and quality assessed using an Agilent 4200 (performed by CapitalBio Technology, Beijing).

Methods Data from four independent MB cohorts encompassing 1,288 patients were analysed. We explored metabolic characteristics of 902 patients (ICGC and MAGIC cohorts) on bulk RNA level.

In DEFND-seq we treat nuclei with lithium diiodosalicylate to disrupt chromatin and expose genoimc DNA. The nuclei are then tagmented with Tn5 transposase, which fragments and tags gDNA. Tagmented nuclei are loaded into a microfluidic droplet generator which combines nuclei, beads containing transcriptomic and genomic barcodes, and reverse transcription reagents into single droplets. Ultimately two libraries are created, one for nuclear mRNA and one for genomic DNA, with each library containing barcodes linking it to its nuclei of origin, thus allowing simultaneous analysis of single nuclei transcriptomes and genomes. Once nuclei have been depleted of nucleosomes, all steps can be performed using a 10x Chromium Controller and 10x Multiome Kit without further experimental modification. Overall design: DEFND-seq (snRNA/DNA-seq), snATAC-seq, snDNA-seq","snATAC-seq: Nuclei were prepared from cryopreserved BJ fibroblasts.

Despite the rise in incidence of appendiceal neoplasms in recent years, limited progress has been made in the understanding, management and therapeutic treatment. To comprehensively characterize the cell types and molecular mechanisms driving cellular remodeling in epithelial appendiceal neoplasms, we performed an integrated scRNA-seq study. We analyzed 126,998 cells from 16 appendix samples (11 peritoneal metastases samples, 5 healthy controls) and identified 33 distinct cell types/cell states with seven being cancer-specific.

This complex microenvironment harbouring infiltrating glioma and non-neoplastic brain cells is the origin of tumor recurrence. Thus, understanding the cellular and molecular features of the glioma microenvironment is therapeutically and prognostically important. Here, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) of primary and recurrent glioma to define three compositional 'tissue-states' rooted in cohabitation of cell-types and transcriptional states. These comprise a state featuring A) minimally infiltrated-brain, B) reactive inflamed infiltrated tissue, and C) cellular tumor. Spatial transcriptomics confirmed that the cell-types and transcriptomics states which compositionally cohabitate indeed do colocalize in space. Tissue states are clinically significant because they correlate with radiographic, histopathologic, and prognostic features. We found that in addition to enrichment of tissue state B signature, enrichment of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell-type gene signatures in tissue state B correlated with decreased survival. Importantly, we found that our compositionally defined tissue states are enriched in distinct metabolic pathways. One such pathway is fatty acid biosynthesis, which was enriched in tissue state B – a state enriched in recurrent glioblastoma and composed of astrocyte-like/mesenchymal glioma cells, reactive astrocytes resembling those seen in neurodegeneration, and monocyte-like myeloid cells. We discovered that targeting fatty acid synthesis was sufficient to deplete the transcriptional signature of tissue state B. Our findings define a novel compositional approach to the glioma infiltrated tissue which allows us to discover prognostic and targetable features, paving the way to new mechanistic and therapeutic discoveries.

Thus, understanding the cellular and molecular features of the glioma microenvironment is therapeutically and prognostically important. Here, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) of primary and recurrent glioma to define three compositional 'tissue-states' rooted in cohabitation of cell-types and transcriptional states.

Our findings define a novel compositional approach to the glioma infiltrated tissue which allows us to discover prognostic and targetable features, paving the way to new mechanistic and therapeutic discoveries. Overall design: Comparative gene expression and molecular analysis on GBM tissue that are primary glioma versus a recurrent glioma.","Briefly, frozen tissue samples measuring from 5 x 4 x 3 mm to 10 x 6 x 3 mm were homogenized using a dounce homogenizer in ice-cold 30% sucrose 0.1% Triton-X 100 based homogenization buffer. 10-15 strokes of the loose dounce pestle were followed by 10-15 strokes of the tight dounce pestle on ice. Mixing using a P1000 pipette followed before filtration through a BD Falcon 40um filters. Filtration was repeated after a 10-minute spin at 1000g at 4c. A cleanup step followed using a density gradient step as described in [41]. The nuclear pellet was suspended in 1% BSA in PBS resuspension buffer containing RNAse inhibitors. A final filtration step using 20um Flowmi ™ filters followed before dilution to 700-1200 nuclei per ul in resuspension buffer. The nuclear suspensions were processed by the Chromium Controller (10x Genomics) using single Cell 3' Reagent Kit v2 or v3 (Chromium Single Cell 3' Library & Gel Bead Kit v2, catalog number: 120237; Chromium Single Cell A Chip Kit, 48 runs, catalog number: 120236; 10x Genomics).

Without proper controls for tissue dissociation experiments, potential artifacts can be mistaken for baseline tissue data. We hypothesized that enzymatic (collagenase/hyaluronidase) compared to mechanical dissociation leads to dissociated related artifacts not found in endogenous tumor tissue. To distinguish artifacts between enzymatic and mechanical dissociation, we compared separate enzymatic and mechanical dissociated samples with baseline samples from healthy and tumor patient whole blood, melanoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumor tissues in flow cytometry, RNA sequencing and CODEX experiments.

We hypothesized that enzymatic (collagenase/hyaluronidase) compared to mechanical dissociation leads to dissociated related artifacts not found in endogenous tumor tissue. To distinguish artifacts between enzymatic and mechanical dissociation, we compared separate enzymatic and mechanical dissociated samples with baseline samples from healthy and tumor patient whole blood, melanoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumor tissues in flow cytometry, RNA sequencing and CODEX experiments.

However, the tumor microenvironment (TME) and transcriptional programs underlying MVI remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing of 46,789 individual cells from 10 samples of MVI+ (MVI present) and MVI- (MVI absent) HCC patients, providing a comprehensive single-cell atlas of MVI. Single-cell dissection of the multicellular ecosystem revealed the emergence or expansion of cycling T cells, LAMP3+ dendritic cells, TREM2+ macrophages, myofibroblasts, and tumor-promoting arterial i endothelial cells within the MVI+ TME. MVI+ malignant cells are characterized by high proliferation rates and the ability to evade immune detection through the upregulation of non-classical MHC class I molecules. In contrast, MVI-malignant cells exhibit an inflammatory milieu. Furthermore, we identified the CCL16/CCR1 interaction between TREM2+ macrophages and malignant cells as a contributing factor in MVI formation and tumor progression. Notably, we identified a unique multicellular module that plays the dominant role in shaping the immunosuppressive microenvironment of MVI and correlates with poor prognosis. In summary, these findings enhance our understanding of the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms driving MVI and provide valuable insights for improving clinical diagnosis and developing more effective treatment strategies.

We discovered a tumor microenvironmental community comprised of aggressive basal-like malignant cells, tumor-promoting SPP1+ macrophages, and myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts associated with especially poor prognosis. We also found a developmental stemness continuum with implications for survival that is present in both malignant cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs).

However, the developmental stemness and co-occurrence of these cell states remain poorly defined. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on a cohort of treatment-naive PDAC time-of-diagnosis endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) samples (n=25). We then combined these samples with surgical resection (n=6) and publicly available samples to increase statistical power (n=80). Following annotation into 25 distinct cell states, cells were scored for developmental stemness and a customized version of the Ecotyper tool was used to identify communities of co-occurring cell states in bulk RNA-seq samples (n=268). We discovered a tumor microenvironmental community comprised of aggressive basal-like malignant cells, tumor-promoting SPP1+ macrophages, and myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts associated with especially poor prognosis. We also found a developmental stemness continuum with implications for survival that is present in both malignant cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). We further demonstrated that high-dimensional analyses predictive of survival are feasible using standard-of-care, time-of-diagnosis EUS-FNB specimens. In summary, we identified tumor microenvironmental and developmental stemness characteristics from a high-dimensional gene expression analysis of PDAC using human tissue specimens including time-of-diagnosis EUS-FNB samples.

Using high-definition white light endoscopy to ensure the efficacy of sample collection, multiple biopsies were taken from the suspected lesion with an additional sample taken from the same location. The former was placed into a cold medium of RPMI (Invitrogen), Primocin (Invivogen) and gentamycin (Invitrogen). To achieve single cell disassociation, specimens were dissected minced and digested using 5 mL of Advanced DMEM/F12 containing 10 mg Collagenase Type 3 (Worthington) and 500 U Hyaluronidase (Sigma) in a Ctube (Miltenyi) using the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi) and resuspended in PBS and 1MM of DDT. The suspension was passed through a 100um cell strainer (Fisher) and centrifuged (500xg at 5 minutes, 4oC). The cells were resuspended in 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and subsequently incubated for 5 minutes at 37oC. The trypsin was then inactivated by adding 10% fetal bovine serum. After being re-centrifuged (500xg, 5 minutes, 4oC) the cell pellet was resuspended in 2.5U Dispase/10ug DNAse buffer and incubated for 5 minutes at 37oC which was then inactivated by adding PBS. The homogenate was then passed though a 40 uM strainer (Fisher) prior to being centrifuged again (500xg, 5 minutes, 4oC). Using ACK Lysing Buffer (Gibco) for 5 minutes at room temperate, red cells were lysed. After adding PBS, and being centrifuged again (500xg, 5 minutes, 4oC), the cell pellet was washed twice with 2% fetal bovine serum in PBS. The substrate was then processed via the 10x Genomics platform. The LightCycler 480 Real Time PCR instrument (Roche) and the KAPA library quantification kid (Roche) were used to quantify cellular libraries with triplicate measurements. These quantification values were used for MGI library conversion and for Illumina sequencing normalization. After 10x library construction, the MGIEasy Universal Library Conversion kit was used ensure all outputs were compatible with MGI sequencers. This conversion circularizes the library by rolling circle amplification that creates a long DNA strand which individually fold into a tight nanoball where each library fragment results in a single DNA nanoball. The DNA nanoballs were quantified with Qubit ssDNA HS assay kit (ThermoFisher), normalized and loaded into the sequencing flowcells using an auto-loading methods (MGI-DL-200R autoloader). The flowcells have a functional surface that captures and immobilizes the DNA nanoballs in a grid like pattern. Two libraries were typically loaded per lane for the single cell RNA sequencing using the DNBSEQ-G400RS PE100 MGI kit with App-A primers on a DNBSEQ-G400 MGI sequencer. Single cell RNA libraries were sequenced with 28 cycles for Read 1, 150 cycles for Read 2 and 8 cycles for the i7 index. Color balancing was achieved with color-balanced single index adapters (10x Genomics) were used for libraries sequenced on MGI. These MGI runs were demultiplexed by fastq-multx In both instances we used a mismatch of 1.

After being re-centrifuged (500xg, 5 minutes, 4oC) the cell pellet was resuspended in 2.5U Dispase/10ug DNAse buffer and incubated for 5 minutes at 37oC which was then inactivated by adding PBS. The homogenate was then passed though a 40 uM strainer (Fisher) prior to being centrifuged again (500xg, 5 minutes, 4oC). Using ACK Lysing Buffer (Gibco) for 5 minutes at room temperate, red cells were lysed. After adding PBS, and being centrifuged again (500xg, 5 minutes, 4oC), the cell pellet was washed twice with 2% fetal bovine serum in PBS. The substrate was then processed via the 10x Genomics platform. The LightCycler 480 Real Time PCR instrument (Roche) and the KAPA library quantification kid (Roche) were used to quantify cellular libraries with triplicate measurements. These quantification values were used for MGI library conversion and for Illumina sequencing normalization. After 10x library construction, the MGIEasy Universal Library Conversion kit was used ensure all outputs were compatible with MGI sequencers. This conversion circularizes the library by rolling circle amplification that creates a long DNA strand which individually fold into a tight nanoball where each library fragment results in a single DNA nanoball. The DNA nanoballs were quantified with Qubit ssDNA HS assay kit (ThermoFisher), normalized and loaded into the sequencing flowcells using an auto-loading methods (MGI-DL-200R autoloader). The flowcells have a functional surface that captures and immobilizes the DNA nanoballs in a grid like pattern. Two libraries were typically loaded per lane for the single cell RNA sequencing using the DNBSEQ-G400RS PE100 MGI kit with App-A primers on a DNBSEQ-G400 MGI sequencer. Single cell RNA libraries were sequenced with 28 cycles for Read 1, 150 cycles for Read 2 and 8 cycles for the i7 index.

However, low patient response rates necessitate the development of robust predictive biomarkers that identify individuals who will benefit from ICB. A 4-gene inflammatory signature, comprising CD8, PD-L1, LAG-3, and STAT1, was recently shown to be associated with a better overall response to ICB in various cancer types. Here, we examined whether tissue protein expression of CD8, PD-L1, LAG-3, and STAT1 predicts response to ICB in HCC. Methods HCC samples from 191 Asian patients, comprising resection specimens from 124 patients (ICB-naïve) and pre-treatment specimens from 67 advanced HCC patients treated with ICB (ICB-treated), were analyzed for CD8, PD-L1, LAG-3, and STAT1 tissue expression using multiplex immunohistochemistry followed by statistical and survival analyses. Results Immunohistochemical and survival analyses of ICB-naïve samples showed that high LAG-3 expression was associated with shorter median progression-free survival (mPFS) and overall survival (mOS). Analysis of ICB-treated samples revealed that high proportions of LAG-3+ and LAG-3+CD8+ cells pre-treatment were most closely associated with longer mPFS and mOS. Using a log-likelihood model, adding the total LAG-3+ cell proportion to the total CD8+ cell proportion significantly increased the predictive values for mPFS and mOS, compared with the total CD8+ cell proportion alone. Moreover, levels of CD8 and STAT1, but not PD-L1, were significantly correlated with better responses to ICB. After analyzing viral-related and non-viral HCC samples separately, only the LAG3+CD8+ cell proportion was significantly associated with responses to ICB regardless of viral status. Conclusion Immunohistochemical scoring of pre-treatment levels of LAG-3 and CD8 in the tumor microenvironment may help predict ICB benefits in HCC patients.

However, low patient response rates necessitate the development of robust predictive biomarkers that identify individuals who will benefit from ICB. A 4-gene inflammatory signature, comprising CD8, PD-L1, LAG-3, and STAT1, was recently shown to be associated with a better overall response to ICB in various cancer types. Here, we examined whether tissue protein expression of CD8, PD-L1, LAG-3, and STAT1 predicts response to ICB in HCC. Methods HCC samples from 191 Asian patients, comprising resection specimens from 124 patients (ICB-naïve) and pre-treatment specimens from 67 advanced HCC patients treated with ICB (ICB-treated), were analyzed for CD8, PD-L1, LAG-3, and STAT1 tissue expression using multiplex immunohistochemistry followed by statistical and survival analyses. Results Immunohistochemical and survival analyses of ICB-naïve samples showed that high LAG-3 expression was associated with shorter median progression-free survival (mPFS) and overall survival (mOS). Analysis of ICB-treated samples revealed that high proportions of LAG-3+ and LAG-3+CD8+ cells pre-treatment were most closely associated with longer mPFS and mOS. Using a log-likelihood model, adding the total LAG-3+ cell proportion to the total CD8+ cell proportion significantly increased the predictive values for mPFS and mOS, compared with the total CD8+ cell proportion alone.

Loss or inactivation of both copies of RB1 results in initiation of retinoblastoma tumours, however additional genetic changes are needed for the continued growth and spread of the tumour. Ex vivo research has shown that in humans, retinoblastoma may initiate from Rb depleted cone precursors.

To overcome these challenges, we have performed the first single cell (sc) RNA- and ATAC-Seq analyses of primary tumour tissues, enabling us to dissect the transcriptional and chromatin accessibility heterogeneity of proliferating cone precursors in human Rb tumours.Methods: Two Rb tumours each characterised by two pathogenic RB1 mutations were dissociated to single cells and subjected to scRNA-Seq & scATAC-Seq using the 10x Genomics platform.

Notwithstanding, it has not been possible to assess the full spectrum of clonal types within the tumour itself in vivo and the molecular changes occurring at the cells of origin, enabling their malignant conversion. To overcome these challenges, we have performed the first single cell (sc) RNA- and ATAC-Seq analyses of primary tumour tissues, enabling us to dissect the transcriptional and chromatin accessibility heterogeneity of proliferating cone precursors in human Rb tumours.Methods: Two Rb tumours each characterised by two pathogenic RB1 mutations were dissociated to single cells and subjected to scRNA-Seq & scATAC-Seq using the 10x Genomics platform. In addition, nine embryonic and fetal retina samples were dissociated to single cells and subjected to scRNA- and ATAC-Seq analyses. The scRNA- and ATAC-Seq data were embedded using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and clustered using Seurat graph based-clustering. Integrated scATAC-Seq analysis of Rb tumours and human embryonic/fetal retina samples was performed to identify Rb cone enriched subsets. Pseudotime analysis of proliferating cones in the Rb samples was performed with Monocle. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to identify the signalling pathway and upstream regulators in the Rb cone enriched subclusters.Results: Our single cell analyses revealed the predominant presence of cone precursors at different stages of the cell cycle in the Rb tumours and amongst those identified the G2/M subset as the cell type of origin. scATAC-Seq analysis identified two Rb enriched cone subsets, each characterised by activation of different upstream regulators and signalling pathways, leading proliferating cone precursors to escape cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis.Conclusions: Our study provides evidence of Rb tumor heterogeneity and defines molecular pathways that can be targeted to define new treatment strategies","Retinal tissue was excised from donated eyes and dissociated to single cells using a multi tissue dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec).

However, abnormal expression of MYB and NOTCH1 was also observed in without MYB-NFIB fusion and NOTCH1 mutation. Here, through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and exome target capture sequencing in two SACC patients without MYB-NFIB fusion and NOTCH1 mutation, we explore in-depth the molecular mechanisms of lung metastasis. Twenty-five types of cells in primary and metastatic tissues were identified via Seurat clustering and categorized into four main stages ranging from near normal to cancer state based on the normal tissue occupancy for each cell cluster. In this context, we identified the Notch signalling pathway enrichment in almost all cancer cells; trajectory and sub-clustering analyses investigated deeply cancer progenitor-like cell clusters in primary tumour-associated lung metastases, in which signature genes enriched in the 'MYC_TARGETS_V2' gene set. In vitro, we detected the complexes of the NICD1-MYB-MYC by Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and incidentally identified retinoic acid (RA) signalling as endogenous antagonists of the 'MYC_TARGETS_V2' gene set. Following this, we validate that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) reduces the lung metastasis in SACC via correcting erroneous cell differentiation mainly caused by aberrant NOTCH1 or MYB expression. Bioinformatic and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses of four primary tissues and eleven metastatic lung tissues from patients with SACC suggested that RA system insufficiency partially promotes lung metastasis. These findings imply the value of diagnosis and treatment of the RA system. Overall design: Cells from fresh tumour tissues were isolated for the preparation of single-cell suspensions via the ChromiumTM Single Cell 3' Solution technique and analysed by BioMiao Biological Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. The 6 sample sequenced were primary salivary gland ACC (A), adjacent normal tissue (AP), lung metastses (A1, B1, C1) and adjacent normal lung tissue (F)","The tissue Dissociation Kit (Tumor Dissociation Kit, Human) is used. Mechanical Dissociation and enzymatic hydrolysis are carried out according to the Dissociation operation steps. The cell suspension is first filtered through 70um and then filtered through 30um, if the number of red blood cells in the single cell suspension is large, Red blood cells need to be removed with RBC lysate to prepare a single cell suspension.After the tissue samples were made into single-cell suspension, luna-FL automatic cell counting apparatus was used to count and measure cell viability. The activity of cultured cells was higher than 90% (the activity of primary cells was higher than 70%). If the cell activity could not meet the standard, the dead cells should be removed with the desiccated cell kit to improve cell viability.

Deconvolution analysis of RNA-expression data from 175 tumors (22 newly sequenced, 153 previously published) revealed Injury-Like tumors are associated with larger tumor size, and scATAC-seq revealed transcription factors associated with nerve repair among SCs from Injury-Like tumors. Ligand-receptor analysis and in vitro experiments suggested that SCs recruit monocytes with secreted ligands. Our study indicates that Injury-Like SCs may cause tumor growth via myeloid cell recruitment and identifies molecular pathways that may be targeted to prevent tumor progression.","Samples processed as single cells were collected at the time of surgical resection and immediately processed. Tumor samples were minced and dissociated using the Human Tumor Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) per manufacturer guidelines. The dissociated cell suspensions were then passed through a 40µm filter, pelleted through centrifugation, and resuspended in AutoMACS Rinsing Solution with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Miltenyi Biotech). Red blood cell lysis was performed on all samples with Gibco ACK Lysing Buffer and was followed by debris removal via density gradient when necessary (Debris Removal Solution, Miltenyi Biotech). Cell viability was confirmed to be >80% using 0.4% Trypan Blue staining and manual counting with a hemocytometer. Samples processed as single nuclei were collected at the time of surgical resection and immediately frozen in OCT compound embedding media (Tissue-Tek, Torrance, California) on a pre-chilled aluminum block resting on dry ice, and stored at -80°C. Tissue scrolls were cut at 30 µm using a Cryostat (50-100 scrolls were cut per sample, depending on the tissue size) and maintained at -80°C until the time of nuclei isolation. Lysis buffer (consisting of Tris-HCl, NaCl, MgCl2, Nonidet P40 Substitute, 0.1M DTT, RNase inhibitor, and nuclease free water) was added to the tissue scrolls, which were homogenized using a Pellet Pestle while on ice. Additional lysis buffer was then added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 5 minutes. The suspension was passed through a 70 µm strainer and centrifuged before being washed with a solution of PBS with 1% BSA and 1U/µl Rnase inhibitor, incubated on ice for 5 minutes, centrifuged, and resuspended in PBS with 1% BSA and 1 U/µl Rnase inhibitor.

How VS heterogeneity and the VS tumor microenvironment (TME) contribute to the pathogenesis of these tumors remains poorly understood. We performed scRNA-seq on 15 VS samples, with paired scATAC-seq in six samples.

Cells were collected (350g, 5 min), resuspended in 1 mL washing buffer consisting of PBS (Ca2+/Mg2+-free, Gibco, 10010-015) and 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, A7906) and sequentially filtered through 100 µm (Falcon, 352360) and 40 µm cell strainers (Falcon, 352340). Apoptotic cells were removed by immunomagnetic cell separation using the Annexin Dead Cell Removal Kit (StemCell Technologies, 17899) and EasySepTM Magnet (StemCell Technologies, 18000). Whenever possible and required, repeat dead cell removal was performed to increase cell viability. Next, cells were washed with a resuspension buffer (PBS with 0.05% BSA), spin down and resuspended in a resuspension buffer. Cell numbers and viability were assessed at each step on a Cellometer K2 Image Cytometer (Nexcelom Bioscience, Cellometer K2) using ViaStain AOPI Staining Solution (Nexcelom Bioscience, CS2-0106-5mL) and PD100 cell counting slides (Nexcelom Bioscience, CHT4-PD100-003). Optimal cell concentrations were set according to 10x Genomics protocols (700-1200 cells/µL). Cells were loaded and processed using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform with the Next GEM Single Cell 3' Reagent Kit v3.1 on 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell Controller (10x Genomics, PN-120263). 4'000 cells were targeted per sample. Gene expression (GEX) libraries were amplified, pooled and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform with addition of 1% PhiX at recommended sequencing depth (20,000-50,000 reads/cell)",10X Genomics,Illumina NovaSeq 6000,RNA-Seq,PAIRED,851,"M.

We determined the single cell transcriptional profile of EAC in patients who were treatment naive or had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Analysis of 52,387 cells revealed 10 major cell subsets of tumor, immune and stromal cells. Prior to chemotherapy tumors were characterised by infiltration with effector T cells showing markers of exhaustion together with large T regulatory cell infiltrates. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells were markedly expanded whilst two dominant cancer-associated fibroblast populations were observed. Pathological remission following chemotherapy was associated with broad reversal of immune abnormalities together with an increase in endothelial and myofibroblast populations although a chemoresistant epithelial stem cell population was apparent. These findings reveal features that underlie and limit the response to current immunotherapy and reveal a range of novel opportunities for targeted therapy. Overall design: Single Cell RNA profile of cells in the EAC tumor microenvironment pre and post neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment","PI was added prior to sorting to exclude non-viable cells.

The nongenetic factors that control aberrant expansion of the normally restricted capability for cell state plasticity to escape terminal differentiation in neoplasia require deeper characterization. Using genetically-engineered and carcinogen-induced murine models of intestinal neoplasia, we demonstrate that impaired differentiation is a conserved event preceding cancer development. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of intestinal neoplasia from both mouse models and a patient with hereditary polyposis revealed that cancer initiates by adopting an aberrant transcriptional state characterized by regenerative activity, marked by Ly6a (Sca-1), and reactivation of fetal intestinal genes, including Tacstd2 (Trop2). Genetic inactivation of Sox9 prevented adenoma formation, obstructed emergence of regenerative and fetal programs, and restored multi-lineage differentiation by scRNA-seq. Expanded chromatin accessibility at regeneration and fetal genes upon Apc inactivation was reduced by concomitant Sox9 suppression. These studies indicate that aberrant cell state plasticity mediated by unabated regenerative activity and developmental reprogramming precedes cancer development. Overall design: scRNA-seq of mouse models of CRC as well as FAP patients associated with study.","Isolated intestines from euthanized mice were washed with ice-cold PBS; villi were scraped using glass slides and dissociated in 5mM EDTA in PBS at 4ºC for 20 minutes, shaking every 5-7 minutes for about 30 seconds. The epithelial fraction was collected by centrifugation and incubated at 37ºC for 30 minutes in pre-warmed 4x TrypLE. Single cells filtered through 70um filter post trypsinization, washed with complete media, and collected in FACS buffer. About 17,000 viable cells were loaded onto a 10X Genomics ChromiumTM instrument (10× Genomics) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The scRNAseq libraries were processed using ChromiumTM single cell 5' or 3' library & gel bead kit (10× Genomics). Matched cell hashing libraries were prepared using single cell 5' feature barcode library kit. Quality controls for amplified cDNA libraries, cell hashing libraries, and final sequencing libraries were performed using Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent). The sequencing libraries for scRNAseq and scTCRseq were normalized to 4nM concentration and pooled using a volume ratio of 4:1. The pooled sequencing libraries were sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq S4 300 cycle platform. The sequencing parameters were: Read 1 of 150bp, Read 2 of 150bp and Index 1 of 8bp.

The nongenetic factors that control aberrant expansion of the normally restricted capability for cell state plasticity to escape terminal differentiation in neoplasia require deeper characterization. Using genetically-engineered and carcinogen-induced murine models of intestinal neoplasia, we demonstrate that impaired differentiation is a conserved event preceding cancer development. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of intestinal neoplasia from both mouse models and a patient with hereditary polyposis revealed that cancer initiates by adopting an aberrant transcriptional state characterized by regenerative activity, marked by Ly6a (Sca-1), and reactivation of fetal intestinal genes, including Tacstd2 (Trop2). Genetic inactivation of Sox9 prevented adenoma formation, obstructed emergence of regenerative and fetal programs, and restored multi-lineage differentiation by scRNA-seq. Expanded chromatin accessibility at regeneration and fetal genes upon Apc inactivation was reduced by concomitant Sox9 suppression. These studies indicate that aberrant cell state plasticity mediated by unabated regenerative activity and developmental reprogramming precedes cancer development. Overall design: scRNA-seq of mouse models of CRC as well as FAP patients associated with study.","Isolated intestines from euthanized mice were washed with ice-cold PBS; villi were scraped using glass slides and dissociated in 5mM EDTA in PBS at 4ºC for 20 minutes, shaking every 5-7 minutes for about 30 seconds. The epithelial fraction was collected by centrifugation and incubated at 37ºC for 30 minutes in pre-warmed 4x TrypLE. Single cells filtered through 70um filter post trypsinization, washed with complete media, and collected in FACS buffer. About 17,000 viable cells were loaded onto a 10X Genomics ChromiumTM instrument (10× Genomics) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The scRNAseq libraries were processed using ChromiumTM single cell 5' or 3' library & gel bead kit (10× Genomics). Matched cell hashing libraries were prepared using single cell 5' feature barcode library kit. Quality controls for amplified cDNA libraries, cell hashing libraries, and final sequencing libraries were performed using Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent). The sequencing libraries for scRNAseq and scTCRseq were normalized to 4nM concentration and pooled using a volume ratio of 4:1. The pooled sequencing libraries were sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq S4 300 cycle platform. The sequencing parameters were: Read 1 of 150bp, Read 2 of 150bp and Index 1 of 8bp.

Enzymatic dissociation was performed with 125?U/ml collagenase I in RPMI-1640 at 37?°C for 35?min. The digested cells were then passed through a 100-µm cell strainer and a 40-µm cell strainer with washes of 1x PBS. The cell suspension was than centrifuged at 1500?rpm for 5?min and erythrocytes were eliminated using a red blood cell lysis kit. WT SIX2+CITED1+ cells were isolated using SIX2-Cy5 and CITED1-Cy3 Smartflare RNA probes following manufacturer's instructions and previous publication. Briefly, cells were incubated over night at 37?°C with both RNA probes diluted at 1:20 in PBS and 25ul/ml in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 5% FBS, and 0.2% antimicrobial agent Primocin. After 16-18 h, cells were dissociation using TrypLE 1x for 5 min, cells were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min and prepared for FACS. Freshly isolated SIX2+CITED1+ cells from a 16 WGA hFK, freshly isolated SIX2+CITED1+ cells from WT8 (favorable stage II Wilms' Tumor), freshly digested xenograft derived from cultured SIX2+CITED1+ cells (Passage 6) isolated from WT8, freshly digested xenograft generated from freshly isolated SIX2+CITED1+ cells from WT8, and total cell population of WT8. Approximately 3,000 cells were captured on a 10x Chromium device using a 10X V2 Single Cell 3' Solution kit. All protocols were performed following manufacturer's instructions. Final library concentrations were determined using a Qubit high Sensitivity DNA assay Kit. Final sequencing libraries were analyzed on a Sequencing: HiSeq 4000, 2x150bp PE, and ~625M total reads/lane (QuickBiology) to determine the library size; Approximately, 300 million reads per sample were sequenced Results: Transcriptomics analysis of Wilms Tumor SIX2+CITED1+ cells in comparison to human fetal kidneys confirmed the nephrogenic signature of hFK-SIX2+CITED1+ and WT-SIX2+CITED1+ cells but highlighted differences in expression of pluripotency and self renewal-related genes.Trajectory inference analysis generated from sc-RNAseq data of SIX2+CITED1+ cells and cells dissociated from total WT (from where the SIX2+CITED1+ cells were isolated), suggests that SIX2+CITED1+ cells are the root cells that give rise to all the tumor cell types. Conclusion: Our study represents the first single cell transcriptomic characterization of Wilms Tumor cancer stem cells (SIX2+CITED1+) against human fetal kidney SIX2+CITED1+ cells and against the total tumor and xenografts from cultured and fresh isolated SIX2+CITED1+ WT cells. Identifying that WT SIX2+CITED1+ cells arise early in nephrogenesis and have an expression pattern favoring proliferation over differentiation that overlaps considerably with the expression pattern of both the tumor of origin and with the expression pattern of WT they generate after grafting.

Methods: Total RNA-seq and miRNA-seq were performed on PDAC tumor and adjacent benigh tissues, and the miRNA profile was also investigated from the patient and healthy subject plasma. Single-cell RNA-seq was performed on one PDAC tissue, using 10x Genomics 5 prime gene expression technology. Results: The RNA-seq and miRNA-seq libraries were sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 550 or HiSeq 4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). All sequencing data were demultiplexed and converted into fastq files by Illumina bcl2fastq2 v2.17.14. Filtered sequence reads were mapped to reference genome GRCh38 using STAR (RNA-seq) or Botwie (miRNA-seq) with default settings. Single cell data was mapped and counted uisng Cellranger (v5.0). Conclusions: We identifed 322 and 49 differentially expressed miRNAs in PDAC tissue and patient plasma, respectively. We also identify 1,445 differentially expressed genes from PDAC tissue and paired the DEGs with their regualtory miRNAs through miRNA functional prediction. Overall design: Tumor and adjacent benign tissues were obtained during surgical resections from PDAC patients. Plasma was obtained from peripheral blood of PDAC patients and healthy control subjects.

In the end, a matrix of gene counts by cells was produced. We processed the UMI count matrix using the Seurat R package (version 4.0.2), resulting in 34,851 cells with 36,601 genes for PCNSL samples. We first removed the likely multiplet captures which is a major concern in microdroplet-base experiments through doubletfinder. We filtered cells at the cell and gene levels to obtain the reliability results of PCNSL scRNA-seq data, respectively. We removed the low qualify cells with the following criteria: (i) The number of expressed genes was <200 or >2,000; (ii) The number of total counts was > 20,000. (iii) The percentage of mitochondrial counts > 10%. We only kept the genes detected in at least 20 cells. After applying these quality control criteria, we obtained 20,307 cells with 12,229 genes in total, which were used for downstream analysis. Similar to normal CNS scRNA-seq data, we used the following criteria: (i) The number of expressed genes was <100 or >3,000; (ii) The number of total counts was > 20,000. (iii) The percentage of mitochondrial counts > 10%. We only kept the genes detected in at least 20 cells. After applying these quality control criteria, we obtained 20,015 cells with 16,608 genes from 21,255 cells with 33,694 genes in total, which were used for downstream analysis.

Different samples present diverse cell compositions, indicating the underlying cellular interactions that affect different cellular infiltration within TME. Importantly, we identify the tumor-associated fibroblasts in both in-house and external scRNA-seq datasets that 1) highly expresses type I collagen genes; 2) dominates the cell-cell interactions in TME through the type I collagen signaling axis; and 3) remodels the TME to a collagen-I-rich extracellular matrix (ECM) similar to the original TME at the primary sites. We also observe the M1 activation of the native microglial cells and the infiltrated macrophages, which may create a proinflammatory TME and be responsible for the high expression of collagen type I in fibroblasts. Moreover, the tumor cell-specific receptors are significantly associated with patients' survival in both brain metastasis and the native glioblastoma cases. Overall, our analyses identify the type I collagen secreting tumor-associated fibroblasts as a key mediator in metastatic brain tumors and reveal the involved tumor receptors associated with patients' survival. Our discoveries provide potential biomarkers for effective therapeutic targets and intervention strategies. Overall design: Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we have profiled five brain tumor tissue samples that are metastasis from breast and lung cancer.","Cellular suspensions were loaded on a Chromium Single Cell Controller (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) to generate single-cell GEMs. Single-cell RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using Chromium™ Single Cell 3' Library & Gel Bead Kit (10x Genomics, P/N-120237).
